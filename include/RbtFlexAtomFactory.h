//RbtFlexDataVisitor class to generate lists of fixed, tethered and free atoms

#include "RbtFlexDataVisitor.h"

//The main use of RbtFlexAtomFactory is to aid with scoring function performance
//enhancements by partitioning model atoms into subsets that are:
// - fixed (never move)
// - tethered (move, but within a predictable radius)
// - free (move freely)
//
//For receptor models, the majority of atoms are FIXED
//The flexible OH/NH3+ terminal atoms are defined as TETHERED
//
//Two categorisations are defined for ligands and solvent 
//depending on the internal flexibility of the model
//
//A) If model is flexible (RbtModel::isFlexible()), all atoms are defined as FREE
//as it is too difficult to take the impact of internal dihedral motion into account
//
//B) If model is not flexible (e.g. explicit solvent), the mapping is:
//transMode == FIXED && rotMode == FIXED => atoms are FIXED
//transMode == FREE => atoms are FREE
//else atoms are TETHERED
//
//On exit:
//User2Value of each tethered atom is set to the maximum displacement
//possible for translational and rotational moves. The value is a
//conservative overestimate as the allowed volume mapped on by each tethered
//atom can be complex. Here we define the sphere radius that includes all
//allowed coordinates.
//The User2Value for fixed and free atoms is set to zero.
